This is an application that converts a DNA sequence to an Amino Acid Sequence.

User can enter a DNA sequence (case does not matter.) I use REGEX to parse out any characters that are not A, C, T, or G.

Then, my algorithm converts it into an amino acid sequence, where each character represents the one-letter code for an amino acid.
